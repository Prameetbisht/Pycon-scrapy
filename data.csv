Measuring Semantic Similarity between sentences in Python,Nikaash Puri (~nikaash),"29 Mar, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/measuring-semantic-similarity-between-sentences-in-python~dJ8Da/,Intermediate,Talks,Scientific Computing,"29 Mar, 2016",7,"The talk will cover a set of approaches to measure semantic similarity between phrases. Concretely, consider the following sentences. ""Harry is running fast"" and ""Harry is Sprinting"". Traditional word-matching algorithms fail to capture the semantic overlap between such phrases. Such similarity scores form essential parts of systems for Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering, Automatic Grading and several other Natural Language Processing applications. The talk will also briefly discuss a Propositional Logic Generation System (PLGS) that converts sentences in natural language to their propositional logic representations. For instance, the sentence ""Harry is running fast"" would be represented as:- - obj(Harry, o1) - run(o1, e1) - prop(e1, fast)in propositional logic. Such propositions form the bedrock of powerful reasoning systems for question answering and Information Retrieval. ,          ","The audience is expected to have a brief idea about the meaning and applications of natural language processing.

We will present the current status of development, how things areimplemented internally, why we chose C++, benchmarks, and examples of usagefrom Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and Julia.,,The Detailed Abstract,,Motivation,,SymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While SymPyturns out to be very useful for many applications, one of the long termproblems with SymPy is that the speed might be insufficient when handling ofvery large expressions is required. Another problem with SymPy is that due tobeing written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use from other languages likeJulia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python to Juliabridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additionaloverhead.,,Methods,,For these reasons, we implemented SymEngine, an open source C++ symbolicmanipulation library, with the goal of being the fastest library for symbolicmanipulation (opensource or commercial), and allowing natural wrappers to otherlanguages like Python (the most mature wrapper), Ruby, Julia and others.,,Results,,We will show benchmarks against other computer algebra systems (opensource andcommercial) as well as examples of usage from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby andJulia. We will present a roadmap how to port SymPy on top of SymEngine.,,We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the codecannot have an undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease ofdevelopment as one is used to from Python).,,The SymEngine C++ library already has 36 contributors, 109 forks and 146 starson GitHub, as of June 30, 2016.,,Conclusion,,SymEngine should fix the slowness of SymPy, while providing a familiarinterface, and at the same allowing many languages to naturaly use it, thuscreating a common platform/tool that many projects (like SymPy, Sage, ...) canuse as their main symbolic engine and all contribute back to it.,          ","Nothing as such, basic math to appreciate examples preferred.,          ","            ,Resources,,Contents of presentation prepared by the SymEngine team lies here https://github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/,,,SymEngine C++ library: https://github.com/symengine/symengine,,SymEngine Python wrappers (with SymPy and Sage integration): https://github.com/symengine/symengine.py,,SymEngine Ruby wrappers: https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb,,SymEngine Julia wrappers: https://github.com/symengine/symengine.jl,,SymPy: http://sympy.org/,,          ","Sumith is currently a third year computer science undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.

In our algorithm to search for the best model, we also plan to compare the parsing output from the most popular open-source text parsers available such as Stanford’s CoreNLP, Python NLTK, SpaCy and Google’s Parsey McParseface. ,,There would soon be a bot interface to the application as well, which would make the application much easier to use — it would seem like you are being guided by a machine learning expert on the other end.,,During the talk, we will explain how the application runs through a battery of pre-processing steps and performs a grid-search like operation on the feature vectors to find the one true classifier.,          ","No programming knowledge required — it is a GUI after all.

Ensemble Models,Prajwal Kailas (~prajwal),"29 Jun, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/ensemble-models~dBnnd/,Beginner,Talks,Data Visualization and Analytics,"25 Jul, 2016",1,"It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-of-art model ?,,Ensemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the power of computing. Ensemble methods aren’t new. They form the basis for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from various base models to create a stronger/better model output.,,This talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.,,Using third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies: 1) Weighted Average 2) Stacking 3)Blending,,Real-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared against single best-performing models.,,We at Unnati Data Labs have built a package for performing the ensembling of machine learning models.,,The motivation was to incorporate the various techniques described into a single python package. The current version of the package has the power to perform weighted averaging, and build stacking and blending models for binary classification. The other ensembling techniques will be incorporated in the future. The package enables data encoding, the desired data on which the user wishes to classify the data, can be encoded in many different ways like label encoding (categorical encoding), one hot encoding, sum encoding, polynomial encoding, backward difference encoding, helmert encoding, and hashing encoding. The encoded data will then be used to train the base models. The package provides the user with the ability to build a number of base models such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi Layer Perceptron, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. The user can build any or all the base models with default parameter values, change the parameter values or provide a list of parameter values to perform hyper parameter optimistaion (Using Hyperopt and Grid Search) and identify the optimum parameter values. Once the desired parameter values have been obtained the respective base models will be trained. Upon training the models, the trained models are used to obtain predictions on the cross validation data, these predictions obtained from the base models will be used to construct a data frame, which will be used to train the stacking and blending models, and perform weighted averaging.,,Once the base models have been trained the user can select which ensembling technique to use. The dataframe of predictions will be used to perform weighted averaging, the same dataframe will be used to train the stacking model, for training the blending model the dataframe of predictions will be appended with the cross validation data. To train the ensemble models the algorithm or classifier which will be used can be any of the algorithms/classifiers provided for the training of the base models. For testing the stacking and blending models we can hold out a test set which can be used to examine how well these ensemble models perform, wether they overfit, underfit, provide better performance than the base models.,,Why this package stands out? First of, the package enables data encoding which provides more flexibility and information which can imporve the performance of the models. The package utilizes hyperopt and gridsearch to perform hyper parameter optimization, so at the time of training the models, we have the optimum parameter values which yields improved performance. Since ensembling involves building and training multiple models with the option of performing hyper parameter optimization, time taken to train these models becomes an issue. To tackle this issue the package makes use of the joblib library for parallelization. With the help of joblib, the various base models are trained in parallel, also the predictions on the cross validation data are obtained by running the predict functions in parallel. For the ensemble models the training of the different ensemble models are done in parallel, so is the testing phase of the ensemble models. This has enabled for a fast, robust, well defined package with immense potential in the world of machine laeenring.,,The package is still in its primary stage, and will continue to be worked upon. Some of the key areas to work on will be adding more base models as well as different ensembling techniques and also expanding to regression, multi class classification and more.,,Creating better models is the critical component of building a good data science product.,          ","Basic knowledge on machine learning and usage of python libraries like sklearn, pandas.,          ","            ,Ensemble Package (Link)https://github.com/unnati-xyz/ensemble-package,          ","A tech enthusiast and an optimist, pursuing his Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering at the National Institute Of Technology, Karnataka.

Token based Authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token),UltimateCoder (~ultimatecoder),"22 Jun, 2016",https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/token-based-authentication-system-using-jwt-json-web-token~aKQzd/,Intermediate,Talks,Web Development,"31 Aug, 2016",3,"JSON Web Token,,Definition,,JWT is standard for making authentication token. JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and encrypted.,,JSON Web Token as Token Based Authentication system,,Unlike session based authentication, Token based authentication system takes very less load of server. In session based authentication system, maintaining of session storage is requires processing and storage. While as Token based authentication system, it is not required to maintain session storage at server side. Tone of processing and storage will be saved. Beauty of using JWT as authentication token is it's simplicity. Once token is created, it is possible to authenticate user without touching the database again. Token can be discarded when it is expired by time from the expire time mentioned in token itself. The JWT is self contained token which has authentication, expire time information and any other user defined claims digitally signed. ,,Usage,,JWT can be used to provide Token Based Authentication system at your ReST API. Because JWT is self contained with required claims it is possible to scale API without depending on Authentication server. ,,Talk Outline:,,,Session Based Authentication Vs Token Based Authentication.,,Advantage of JWT as Authentication token.,,Example of JSON Web Token, Will explain various parts like Header, Payload and Signed MAC.,,Algorithms that can be used to sign JWT Payload.,,Explain various claims used for JWT.,,Demonstrate,,Creating JWT and sending to requested client,,How to validate given JWT with respect to time and payload values.,,Best practice to create JWT.,,Practical example of JWT as Django Authentication module.,,,Some notes on Oauth 2.0,,Oauth 2.0 uses JWT as token exchange standard. Using JWT is simple and more efficient when we have to design authentication system for our internal client who are not user of any Oauth provider like Gmail, Facebook etc. OAuth 2.0 contains many payload values which increase token size and it requires time to transfer where as using JWT, it is possible to get small size token with best security as Oauth 2.0,,Slide Outline,,Token Based Authentication system using JWT,,By Jaysinh Shukla,,,Speaker Description,,,,,Role:, Full stack developer,,,,Github:,,1 http://github.com/ultimatecoder,,2 http://github.com/jsh-odoo,,,,Twitter:, ,@jaysinhp,,,,Email:, ,jaysinhp@gmail.com,,,,IRC:, thebigj,,,,,Types of Authentication,,,Session / Cookie Authentication,,Token Authentication,,,,Session Authentication for Multiple User,,,,Session or Cookie Authentication,,,,Client sends authentication credentials (username and password) to Server.,,,,Server verifies authentication credentials,,,if valid, assigns ,session storage,, creates ,session id, and returns  session id to requested client.,,,,,Client stores ,session id, probably at ,Cookie, storage.

While a naive search bar that simplified information extraction and delivery of web pages was the rage in early 2000s, exponential increase in data and information on the Internet is making it natural for the search bar to evolve into a smarter and responsive interface. Not only can this search bar be more responsive in terms of guiding users in an iterative aka conversation based search, but it can also be assistive in fetching information that suits the interests of different users. Sooner or later, such conversational interface will replace the old-generation search bar.,,However, building such conversational interface has several technology challenges: a) the interface has to understand and extract intent from natural human inputs in terms of text or speech (this is partly done by the current generation search interfaces), b) it has to generate meaningful dialogue responses to engage users into a conversation, c) it has to understand and use context to assist users in fetching the most relevant information, and while doing so d) make the information results personalized to the user as she uses the interface over time.,,How do we solve these technology challenges? Is the ‘conversational search’ a hype or soon to be reality? How are recent advances in deep learning playing their role towards building such ‘chat bots’? How can we build a real interactive search interface using existing web (or Django) and machine learning frameworks. In this talk, I will take a deep dive to answer these questions and present the state of the art in building conversational agents during Django and Tensorflow (and Python, of course!). Tensorflow is a machine/deep learning package (using Python) open sourced by Google and has several advanced features to parse user text queries and personalize search results.,,Specifically, I will talk about building Django-based rest frameworks without and with websockets to enable interactive text search interfaces. Such interfaces are expected to become pervasive in coming years to replace web search bar, e-commerce search bars or any domain specific search engines such as education, healthcare etc. I will talk about implementation details of API using Django to enable such interface.

Can I create recommendations purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search? How do I use natural language processing techniques to create valid recommendations?,,This talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state-of-the-art technique - word2vec. We will create something that not only matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative recommendations. The beauty of such a framework is that not only does it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in user tone and behavior.,,The trick/secret sauce is - How do we account for the 'context' and build it in our systems? The talk will answer these questions and showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.,,MOTIVATIONS & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:,,The current recommender systems tend to misfire when user history is not known or new products are introduced into the mix. Missing user ratings add more complexity and create hindrances to relevant recommendations. Also, the current websites, especially in the domain of  food or travel, don't allow me to do a contextual search, like "",best chicken tikkas in South Delhi,"". The results depend on the keywords appearing in the title or description, but rarely in the reviews + user browsing history.,,We have built two models using word2vec, which are;,,META MODEL:, Created with the user browsing history. This contains more than 9.4 million product histories. The attempt is to mimic and improve upon existing collaborative filtering systems.,,USER REVIEW MODEL:,Currently websites don’t allow us to search on “context”. This model intakes reviews and attempts to create a framework for a “contextual search engine”.,,This is our attempt to propose and demonstrate a framework that’s more rounded and preserves context while generating recommendations.

It comes under one of the crucial tasks in natural language processing for purposes of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured (text) datasets.Keyphrases provide a concise description of a document’s content; they are useful for document search, clustering, categorization, and summarization; help in building a content based recommendation system as you can quantify semantic similarity with other documents. Since we are producing raw data now more than ever, clustering and contextualizing data becomes a more difficult task. With the help of Python and specifically NLTK it becomes a tad bit easier. ,,My talk will provide information regarding methodology, keyphrase selection (unsupervised and supervised methods), algorithms which help us quantify weights relative to document corpus followed by a step wise guidance on building a decent keyphrase extraction system using NLTK in Python.   ,,This project is a part of my GSoC project. ,          ","A basic understanding of Python.
